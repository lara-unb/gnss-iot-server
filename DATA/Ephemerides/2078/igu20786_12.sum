REMARKS concerning the IGU Orbit Combination:                                  
---------------------------------------------

 1. The following centre clock solutions, which provide broadcast and/or 
    predicted broadcast clock corrections, were excluded from the combination
    but kept in the combination statistics:
    
             -> Broadcast Centre: GOU COU 
    
    The reference time scale is based on a linear alignment to the clocks
    of a particular centre, which is normally pre-aligned to broadcast GPS
    time.  The reference centre is chosen from the following list, in order
    of availability, and is indicated by 0 TOFT, 0 TDRFT, and non-zero RMS
    in Table 1:
    
             -> Reference Centre: EMU USU ESU GFU
    
    Starting on 1-Jul-2009 (GPS Week 1538, day 3, hour 12; MJD 55013.5),
    clock predictions are excluded for satellites set unhealthy due to MX
    or UNUSUFN NANU events.  The centre clock statistics in Table 1 do not
    include the excluded satellites; however, these are included in the later
    IGU center comparison statistics with the IGS Rapid clocks.
    
    Starting 3-Feb-2012 (GPS Week 1673, day 5, hour 00; MJD 55959.0), a new
    solution from Wuhan University (WHU) is included for comparison only. Starting
    27-Feb-2012 (GPS Week 1677, day 1, hour 12; MJD 55984.5), a new solution
    from NOAA/National Geodetic Survey (NGU) is included for comparison only.
    
    Two changes were made to the IGU starting 8-Aug-2012 (GPS Week 1700, day 3,
    hour 12; 56147.5). The WHU and NGU orbits are now included with full weight,
    and any AC contribution with orbital frame rotations larger than 300 uas will
    be excluded. This threshold is consistent with those used in the IGR rapid
    combination.

 2. The following orbit solutions were excluded from the combination because
    less than 3 ACs have submitted results for given satellite(s).
    The following table lists the exclusions:

 3. Starting 5-Nov-2006 (GPS Week 1400, day 0, MJD 54044) until 16-Apr-2011
    (GPS Week 1631, day 6, MJD 55667) all IGS products, including the IGS
    combined orbits, are based on the IGS realization of the ITRF2005 reference
    frame (IGS05).   For more information see IGSMAIL #5447.  The IGS05 frame is
    also the basis for the homogeneously reprocessed IGS products from GPS Weeks
    730 to 1459 (1994-2007); see IGSMAIL #6136.
    
    Starting 17-Apr-2011 (GPS Week 1632, day 0, MJD 55668) all IGS products,
    are based on the IGS realization of the ITRF2008 reference frame (IGS08).
    For more information see IGSMAIL #6354.
    
    Starting 07-Oct-2012 (GPS Week 1709, day 0, MJD 56207) all IGS products,
    are based on the updated IGS08 frame (IGb08). 
    For more information see IGSMAIL #6663.
    
    Starting 29-Jan-2017 (GPS Week 1934, day 0, MJD 57782) all IGS products,
    are based on the IGS realization of the ITRF2014 reference frame (IGS14). 
    For more information see IGSMAIL #7399.

 4. Starting 5-Nov-2006 (GPS Week 1400, day 0, MJD 54044) until 16-Apr-2011
    (GPS Week 1631, day 6, MJD 55667) the absolute antenna model is introduced
    (IGSMAIL #5438). The antenna phase center offsets and phase center variations
    are given in the file:
        ftp://igs.org/igscb/station/general/igs05.atx
    These antenna calibrations are also used in the homogeneously reprocessed IGS
    products from GPS Weeks 730 to 1459 (1994-2007); see IGSMAIL #6136.
    
    Starting 17-Apr-2011 (GPS Week 1632, day 0, MJD 55668) the absolute antenna
    model is updated (IGSMAIL #6255 & #6374) as given in the file:
        ftp://igs.org/igscb/station/general/igs08.atx
    
    Starting 07-Oct-2012 (GPS Week 1709, day 0, MJD 56207) the igs08.atx absolute
    antenna model file gives updated (IGSMAIL #6662) values for the JPSREGANT_DD
    and JPSREGANT_SD antennas, plus updates for GPS IIF transmit antennas. This
    updated file should be used in conjunction with IGb08. Though, igs08.atx is
    also still consistent with IGS08.
    
    Starting 29-Jan-2017 (GPS Week 1934, day 0, MJD 57782) the absolute antenna
    model file has been updated to igs14.atx to be consistent with IGS14.
    See IGSMAIL #7399 for more information

         average combination. 

         The last column gives the IGU resulting satellite accuracy measures 
         found in the IGS SP3 header. Eclipsing satellites are flagged with 
         "E" (or "M" for moon) beside the PRN number. "X" stands for excluded
         from RMS,  WRMS and MEDI-combination statistics but included in IGU

                 provides ERP-products for all combinations.
